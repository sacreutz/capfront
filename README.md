Included is the skeleton of a React-like framework and some basic React-like
components. Your task is to implement each of the TODOs to create a working
single-page app. The comments use JSX to indicate intent. You should use DOM
object creation/manipulation yourself instead of using JSX. The Header
component has been implemented as an example.

Clicking on a Link component should cause the page to render the appropriate
page body depending on the route.

This challenge should take 30-60 minutes to complete.
